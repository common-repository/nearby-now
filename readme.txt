The Nearby Now plugin allows you to display your customer reviews, job locations with photos and videos, and a service area heat-map on any blog post or web page via a short code.

== Description ==

[Nearby Now](https://www.nearbynow.co) for WordPress is an awesome way to add your real-time Nearby Now reviews and checkins, along with an eye-catching interactive service area heat-map to your website. Here's a quickstart guide:

###Heatmap

Our most powerful shortcode, the heatmap includes.

1. A large interactive service area heat-map combined with interactive review markers.
2. A wide column of your reviews, properly coded so that search engines recognize them as reviews of your business.
3. A narrow column of your check-ins, along with related comments and photos.
4. A masonry tiled layout option for an even more modern look.

Place the heatmap on city-specific pages to provide for unique, rich, dynamic, and schema formatted content that is specific to that city in order to bolster rankings for each city your business services.

Please login to the admin portal and view the knowledgebase for a list of all available options with the heatmap short-code, as well as additional short code options.
